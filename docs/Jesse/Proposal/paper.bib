abstract ={A technique of approximate symmetrization is used to derive a test space from a given trial space for a Petrov—Galerkin method. This is applied to one-dimensional diffusion—convection problems to give approximations which are near optimal in an energy norm. Rigorous and precise error bounds are derived to demonstrate the uniformly good behaviour and near optimality of the procedure over all values of the mesh Péclet number.},

The underlying discretization scheme is the Shock-capturing Streamline Diffusion method. The adaptive algorithms proposed are based on a posteriori error estimates for this method leading to reliable methods in the sense that the desired error control is guaranteed. A priori error estimates are used to show that the algorithms are efficient in a certain sense.},
