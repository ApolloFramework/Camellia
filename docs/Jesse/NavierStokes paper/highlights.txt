Highlights

We summarize the higher order adaptive Discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin method.

We extrapolate a DPG method for convection-diffusion problems to nonlinear systems.

We present numerical results using adaptivity for a Burgers' equation with a shock.

We present adaptive results for two model problems in viscous compressible flow.
